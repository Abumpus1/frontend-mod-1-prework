## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
   - One idea that resonated with me is to have the outlook that mistakes _are_ me learning, and not just failures, but a path to improvement. One thing that I didn't fully consider before is that a growth mindset needs you to seek out challenges, and to keep pushing to get better.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
   - I don't let mistakes make me give up, and I ask questions if I get stuck. I need to get better at setting specific attainable goals, and challenge seeking.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
   - Arrays would likely be used in displaying videos on youtube. whenever you are on a video there is a list of more videos to watch on the sidebar, which would likely be displayed with the help of arrays to display each video title and thumbnail.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
   - An array method is a function you can add to the end of an array to affect the elements in the array. For example if I had an array named 'foods' I could type foods.pop() to remove the last element in the array.
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
   - The purpose of a loop is to repeat a set of code multiple times. We would use a loop without an array if for example we wanted to output something to the console a set number of times, and we might for example use a loop with an array if we wanted to output each element of an array to the console or if we wanted to affect each element of an array with the same code.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
   - Loops are used to to do the same thing multiple times. If loops were used in real life it might be used if you had to draw an apple a bunch of times, you would use a loop so you didn't have to draw every apple.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
   - Is the ";" at the end of "var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];" needed? If so should I be putting it at the end of other variables I declare?
