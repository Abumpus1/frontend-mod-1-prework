# Section 3 - Arrays and Loops

Section 3 is estimated to take a total of 6-10 hours to complete. Similar to the previous sections, this section of pre-work involves reading (both from this document as well as the üìíJohn Duckett book), üë©üèª‚Äçüíªexercises, and üìùreflection questions. Make sure to manage your time well so that should you get stuck and need help, you have plenty of time to do so and meet the deadline. 

Since Arrays are a bigger topic, it is the main focus of this section. Some review work from the first two sections has been woven in so you get opportunities to continue seeing and applying those concepts, as well.

## Open your local copy of frontend-mod-1-prework

Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository. If you are having trouble with this, see the day_1 README.

## Part A Section 3 Focus

Content TBD

## Part B Arrays

üìíRead pages 70 and 72 in the `JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY: Interactive Front-End Web Development` book.

üé¨Watch [this video to hear an explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUnV-fCY0Pc) and watch someone apply some of the concepts you read about in the book. The person who recorded this video is writing JavaScript in the browser Develeper Tools. Open them with in Chrome with the keyboard shortcut `cmd + opt + i`, and click Console.

Research the array methods below on the MDN documentation provided. This documentation might seem intimidating at first, but you will need to get comfortable looking at it. üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªCreate a file in your `section3` directory called `array_methods.md` and describe, in your own words, what each method does.
* Methods to research: `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `unshift`. Take a look at the [MDN documentation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array). Hint: the methods are listed in a column on the left hand side of the website.
* _Note: The MDN documentation makes use of the variable declarations `const` and `let`. For now, just read them as `var` instead._

## Part C Loops

Define iteration - take from M0

### For Loops

Sometimes we have a collection of data (like an array) and we want to do something to each item in the collection. In these instances, we need to **iterate** or **loop** through each piece of data in our collection.

üìíRead pages 170-174 of the `JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY: Interactive Front-End Web Development` book.

üé¨Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9wW2PpJsmQ) to hear an explanation and see someone write a `for` loop! Remember, when you see `let`, pretend it is `var`. You will learn the differences between those, at a very deep level, in Mod 2.

### For Loop and Arrays



> üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªPAUSE here, and complete the exercises in `loops-arrays.js`

## Exercises

At this point, you should have worked through all files in the `exercises` directory. Confirm that you have before moving on.

## Reflection

Answer the questions in the `reflection.md` file in the section3 directory.

## Save your work in Git

When you are finished with all of the `section3` activities, use the Git workflow and commands you've learned to add and commit your work. Write a commit message that concisely summarizes what work this commit contains. If you need a refresher on that workflow, look at the Mod 0 lesson where this was covered, of the directions in Sections 1 or 2.

## Push to GitHub

You've save your work to Git on your local machine, but it is not yet accessible through your remote Github repository. Push your code to your remote repository. If you don't remember the command, look back at the directions in Sections 1 or 2.

Visit your GitHub repository to verify the work you did for this section was pushed successfully!

## Deliverables

In the appropriate thread in your pre-work group channel, share the following:

1. Link to the commit you made with your complete Section 3 pre-work
2. A short video of yourself reflecting on:
