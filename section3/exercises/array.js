//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.


// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"


// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.


// YOU DO: Write code using bracket notation that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array


//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)


// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.


// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added


// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed


// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array. 
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added

// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.

// Part 3: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter 
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
