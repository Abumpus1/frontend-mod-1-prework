## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
    - I think it felt a little better breaking it into chunks and taking breaks, I think it kept my mind a bit fresher as I worked most of the time.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
    - I don't think it went as well as it could have, I found I had a hard time estimating how long things would take. I think I have a hard time working with the exact 25 minute increments, but taking a small break after finishing a smaller portion of work(usually 25-50 minutes worth) seemed to work a bit better for me.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
    - An Object stores data in key-value pairs, a value linked with a string, while an Array is just a list of values which are only linked to their index number(0, 1, 2 etc).  
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array, no value that it needs to pair to
  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object, needs to pair states with capitals
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Array, no value it needs to pair to
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array, nothing it needs to pair to
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object, needs to pair the student to the cohort they are in
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object, key would be ingredient, value is amount, needs to be paired
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array, simple list, nothing to pair to

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
    - A possible example might be the youtube videos you can click on in the Youtube Homepage, might have keys like "title", "channel", and "views". Might have values "Learn Javascript programming...", "whatsdev", and 22000, respectively.
1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
    - what does "this." do exactly? Why are classes PascalCase when seemingly everything else so far has been camelCase?
