## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
   - I think I feel pretty good about asking questions at the proper time, if I had to guess a side I'd fall on, I suspect I might end up waiting a bit longer than I should, but only time will tell. Obviously I hope I'll find the right balance.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
   - It felt generally a bit uncomfortable at first not having exact direction, like taking the training wheels off, but I think it helped me further engrain the the things I learned and encourages me to get into the habit of seeking out additional info.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
   - Conditional statements are a way to make decisions in programming, "if this, do this, otherwise do this". One life example might be filling my cat's food bowl in the morning if it is empty. One web example might be logging into a site, if I input the correct username and password I login, if I don't input correctly I don't get in.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
   - With the `else if` statement. `if` first value comes back as true regarding this statement, do this, `else if` it came back as false but it comes back as true for this statement, do this. if the value comes back as true for the first statement, it will disregard further `else if` statements for that value.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
   - You can use `&&` between two conditions, which would only output as true if both conditions are true, or use `||` between two conditions, which would output as true if at least one of the two conditions are true.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
   - Can the phrase 'conditional statement' be used interchangeably with 'if statement'? Are they generally talking about the same thing? Or are there conditional statements that don't use if/else statements but something else?
