## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
   - I've noticed myself benefit from some of these in the past. I probably don't do any of these enough, but I think teaching or explaining to others can work really well for me to remember what I've learned, so I will likely take any chances I get to do so in the future. Only thing I can think of is to add getting good sleep.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
   - String: absolutely anything in "quotations" is a string.
   - Numbers: any number, no commas. 4, -4, 0.4, 4000..
   - Booleans: True or False.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
   - console.log("Hello, World!");
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
   - "// message here" or "/* message here */", purpose would be to add notes of what the following lines of code are doing, both for other people, and to look back on and remember for yourself.  
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
   - A variable stores a value to be used later. A variable is kind of like a sandwich bag, you can put anything in there, like a bunch of goldfish crackers for example, and any time you want a goldfish, you know what to pull from.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
   - Tiktok: user names(strings) likes on a video(numbers) whether or not I personally liked a video(boolean)
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
   - Concatenation is the joining of 2 or more variables, using the + operator
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
   - some apps give users a number along with their username, an example would be Discord, where your name would look like this: Bob#1234, I figure it may happen here
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
   - I think I like Interpolation more than concatenation and so far it seems to be able to do the same things, why do they both exist? is there ever a reason to use concatenation over interpolation? or vice versa.
